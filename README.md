# Car Dealership Application

With this application, the user is able to access a multitude of features that would be useful for a salesman or a sales manager at a car dealership.

Users are able to search for vehicles based on different criteria that are catered to what they are searching for. They are also given the option to view
all vehicles in their inventory list, as well as add or remove a vehicle from their inventory list.
## Home Screen

#### The Home Screen is where users are greeted and prompted to view vehicles by:

- Price
- Make/Model
- Year
- Color
- Mileage
- Type

The user is also able to:
- View all vehicles in the vehicle inventory list
- Add a vehicle from the vehicle inventory list
- Remove a vehicle from the vehicle inventory list

No matter which option the user chooses, they are always brought back to the Home Screen to select another option 
from the Home Screen or to simply exit the application.

## Interesting Piece of Code
```
String newVehicleMake;
            while (true) {
                newVehicleMake = scanner.next().trim();
                if (newVehicleMake.matches(".*\\d.*") || newVehicleMake.isEmpty()) {
                    System.out.println("* Please enter in a vehicle make.");
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            
int minYear;
            while(true) {
                if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
                    minYear = scanner.nextInt();
                    break;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("* Please enter in a number.");
                    scanner.next();
                }
            }
```

I found this piece of code interesting because by using it, I was able to ensure that the user input will be a String and 
therefore not error when writing to the file and then reading from it later on. The second piece of code I included is similar
except it ensures that the user input is an int/double and prevents the same writing to file and reading from file error.
